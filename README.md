## 📖 Project Description

**Coffee-House** is a simple terminal-based coffee shop management system developed using the **C programming language**. It simulates a real-world cafe ordering system where customers can view a menu, place orders, and receive a bill. Admin users can log in using a secure password to access additional controls (if extended in the future).

This mini-project was created as part of a C programming coursework or personal learning project to practice fundamental C concepts, including user input/output, control structures, arrays, functions, and basic console interaction.
